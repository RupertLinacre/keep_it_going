# Tiny Tracks

A standalone endless miniature coaster game. Solve multiplication products to give the train a momentum boost; every three correct answers adds another cart.

## Run locally

Requires Node.js 22.12 or newer (Node 24 LTS recommended).

```sh
npm ci
npm run dev
```

```sh
npm test
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## GitHub Pages

The Vite build uses relative asset paths, so it works from a repository subdirectory. The workflow in `.github/workflows/pages.yml` tests, builds, and deploys the site whenever `main` is pushed, or when run manually.

In the GitHub repository settings, choose **GitHub Actions** as the Pages source. No repository-name configuration is required.
